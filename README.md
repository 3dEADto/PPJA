# Resources

There are many valuable resources out there when you need help with JsonAssets

• Blank JsonAsset Template: https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1746/?
• Event Data (valid PurchaseRequirement fields) - https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data#Event_preconditions
• (Dated but describes fields) CustomCrops documentation - https://spacechase0.com/mods/stardew-valley/custom-crops/

# Spreadsheet

This is our mega-guide. Of nearly every crop, tree, recipe, artisan good,, flower, etc. It does not include everything that has been released, but those items are largely fantasy items that are unlikely to have conflicts. 
We keep this sheet updated for a few reasons:

- To ensure compatibility between packs
- To avoid duplicate names (see compatibility) 
- To have a resource where users of JA can find documentation
